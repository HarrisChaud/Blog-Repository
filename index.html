      <h2>Week 1 Blog:</h2>
      <p>I read an article describing the top 10 uses 
        that html has been used for in the real world. There are many 
        interesting facts that I learned while reading 
      this article. Such as the fact that every single
      page that we see on the world wide web is actually is
    written using a version of HTML code. Many of the real 
    world uses of HTML include working witht the web. I 
   found it interesting that html is used in so many aspects
  that i never considered such as creating responsive images,
game development usage, and client-side storage which is feasible by
using local storage and indexDB.</p>

<p>I also found it really interesting that HTML5, is being 
  used to introduce the latest trends in the website creation business. 
  Things such as polyfill libraries, which are supported by old browsers 
  equally as well. HTML5 is also being used for offline capabilities usage.
  HTML5 has it's application cache mechanism, which defines how the browser
  manages the offline situation. By using the certain property in HTML5, a
  develepor can check if the application is online or not.
