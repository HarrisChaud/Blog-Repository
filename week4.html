    <h1>Week 4 Blog</h1>
    <p>
      This week I got a chance to learn about the best practices that are used
      in modern javascript. Javascript allows the user to declare variables in
      many different ways, but not every way may be valid compared to others for
      example using <strong>var</strong> to declare variables. This way of
      declaring variables have been used since the inception of javascript, but
      it comes with many setbacks such as not being able to have block scored
      definitions. Since the variables defined by <strong>var</strong> are not
      block-scoped, redefining them in a narrower scope affects the value of the
      outer scope. In modern Javacript most developers now use
      <strong>let</strong> and <strong>const</strong> to declare variables,
      these differ from <strong>var</strong>, for example you cannot reassign
      <strong>const</strong> variables.
    </p>
    <div class="Example">
      <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
      <p>let y = 10</p>

      <p>if (true) {</p>
      <p>let y = 15 // inner declaration is scoped within the if block</p>
      <p>console.log(y) // prints 15</p>
      <p>}</p>
    </div>
    <p>
      Javascript also allows the user to create arrow functions, which have
      advantages over regular functions. One of the advanatages of arrow
      functions is that they exist within the parent functions, this helps us by
      removing a lot of conflicts when we are using the
      <strong>this</strong> keyword. for a single expression inside the arrow
      functions it's implied we don't have scope brackets
      <strong>{}</strong> and no return
      <strong>keyword</strong>
    </p>
    <div class="Example">
      <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
      <p>let y = [2, 4, 6, 8]</p>
      <p>y.map(val => val * 2) //[4, 8, 12, 16]</p>
    </div>
    <p>
      Javascript provides us with the null-ish coalescing operator
      <strong>??</strong>
      if you want to assign a value to a variable if and only if the value is
      currently null-ish. A logical way to write this would be:
    </p>
    <div class="Example">
      <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
      <p>if (x === null) {</p>
      <p>x = y</p>
      <p>}</p>
      <p>Instead we can do this:</p>
      <p>// x = y if x is nullish, else no effect</p>
      <p>x ??= y</p>
    </div>
    <p>
      This operator along with the logical AND <strong>&&=</strong> and logical
      OR <strong>||=</strong> make our code a lot easier and cleaner to look at.
      Learning these new javascript techniques makes coding easier in
      javascript.
