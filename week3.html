      <h1>Week 3 Blog --September19th</h1>
      <p>
        This week I got the chance to read an article about creating animations
        in CSS. CSS animations consist of two components which include a style
        which will describe the animation and a set of keyframes. CSS animations
        are at an advantage when it comes to creating simple animations compared
        to Javascript. The animation style can be configured with the
        <strong>animation properties.</strong> This will also allow you to edit
        the time, duration. Some of the sub-animation properties of animation
        are
        <strong
          >animation-name, animation-timing-function, animation-delay,</strong
        >
        etc. Keyframes use a percentage to indicate the timer. We can also make
        the animations move back and forth by specifying the
        <strong>animation-direction </strong>
        CSS gives us options to move the text in either direction as well as
        alternate text.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the user would like to repeat the animation we can include a
        <strong>animation-iteration-count</strong> which lets the user specify
        how many times the iteration will be repeated. We can give our
        animations multiple properties, CSS accepts multiple properties this
        feture is very useful when you want to apply multiple properties to your
        animation we can say
        <strong>animation-name: fadeInOut, moveLeft100px.</strong> You can also
        gain more functionality with animations by using animation events.
        <strong>AnimationEvent</strong>
        can detect the start, finish, and begin of a new iteration. Animations
        are a fun way to be able to communicate emotions and ideas across in an
        easy way.

    <p>Example of a simple animation:</p>
    <h2 class="animation">Animations are fun</h2>
