        If I were to teach CS347 in Spring 2022 I would like to make some
        changes to how the course is structured overall. I think the first part
        of the class was fun. I think the project1 with html and css taught me a
        lot about styling and creating a website using html and css. I would
        like to keep this part of the class the same. I found the book to be
        really helpful because it was easy to solve any problems regarding the
        css and html. I would split this course so that once everyone is
        comfortable with CSS and HTML they will be able to learn Javacript,
        before having to learn any node js or react. I think this would ease the
        transition from html/css into js and react. Since I personally had a
        hard time making that transition. I would make the students do the same
        projects that we have done this semester, because I think those projects
        are really good for getting a basing understanding of front end.

        I think that there are a lot of resources that can be used to learn the
        material that is taught in this class. It's easier to find help online
        if you at least understand what problem you are facing. There were many
        times I felt like I did not know how to solve a problem just because the
        class was moving too quickly and it was hard to keep up with the
        readings that were assigned each week. I personally think I could have
        gotten more out of this course if I was to learn these concepts slower.
