      This week I read about react js and the concepts that are important to
      master so that it is easier to understand react js. The first important
      concept to master is how react components work. This is important since
      everything in react is an component. A good example of a component is the
      common &ltselect&gt component. A React component simply outputs HTML like
      a traditional template would, but also includes the code. The most common
      way to write components is
    </p>
    <div class="Example">
      <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
      <p>class MyComponent extends React.Component {</p>
      <p>render() { return Hello World! &ltp&gt</p>
      <p>}</p>
    </div>
    <p>
      Props and State are another concept that is crucial to start coding in
      react Prop components are short for properties. Props are the reason
      components can communicate with each other.
    </p>
    <div class="Example">
      <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
      <p>class ChildComponent extends React.Component {</p>
      <p>
        render() { return &ltp&gt And then I said,
        “{this.props.message}”&ltp&gt; }
      </p>
      <p>}</p>
    </div>
    <p>
      This also means data can only go from parent componenets to their
      children, no children to the parent. Sometimes a component comes fronm the
      state, its a temporary user input. inside the component state is managed
      using the setState function.
    </p>
    <p>
      React is much more about actually mastering programming and architectural
      concepts rather than actually having to learn API methods. Though Another
      useful component is the constructor which can be used to initialize your
      state and the bind methods.
